# react-state 🐾

This is a small React project built with Vite to practice **React state management** and **event handling**. The app generates a random animal name when a button is clicked, then displays a corresponding image.

Next to each animal image, a small heart icon appears. When the animal's image is clicked, the heart **grows in size** — visually representing affection or interaction, and reinforcing the concept of managing component-specific state.

This project was both fun and informative. It helped me clear up some ambiguous concepts around how state works in React, especially how to:

- trigger updates with user events,
- manage individual component state,
- and conditionally render UI based on that state.

## 🔧 Stack

- **React**
- **Vite**
- **ESLint**
- No external state management library — this is all about learning vanilla React state!

## 🚀 How to run it

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## 🔍 What I Learned

- How to update component state using `useState`
- Event handling in React
- Conditional rendering
- Component re-rendering logic
- The importance of immutability and state isolation
